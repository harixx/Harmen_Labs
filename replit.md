# Harmen Labs - Static Website

## Overview

This is a static website for Harmen Labs, an AI agents enterprise company. The project is built as a Flask-based static file server that serves multiple HTML pages with modern glassmorphism design. The website showcases the company's services, case studies, blog content, and contact information with a focus on AI agent solutions for enterprise clients.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Static HTML Pages**: Multi-page website with dedicated sections (Home, About, Services, Case Studies, Blog, Contact)
- **Styling Framework**: Tailwind CSS via CDN for rapid UI development
- **Typography**: Google Fonts integration with Space Grotesk, Inter, and JetBrains Mono
- **Design System**: Glassmorphism aesthetic with gradient backgrounds and backdrop blur effects
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind's responsive utilities

### Backend Architecture
- **Web Server**: Flask-based Python application serving static files
- **Routing**: Simple file-based routing with fallback to index page
- **Error Handling**: Graceful 404/500 error handling with redirects to main page
- **Port Configuration**: Environment-aware port configuration (defaults to 5000)

## Key Components

### Static Pages
- `index.html` - Main landing page with conversion funnel, social proof, and lead magnet
- `about.html` - Company information and team details
- `services.html` - Service offerings and capabilities
- `case-studies.html` - Client success stories and project showcases
- `blog.html` - Company blog and thought leadership content
- `contact.html` - Progressive contact forms with industry classification

### Conversion Optimization Features
- **Clear Conversion Funnel**: 3-step process (Assess → Consult → Deploy) guiding users from awareness to action
- **Social Proof**: Client testimonials, company logos, and trust indicators building credibility
- **Lead Magnet**: Free AI Readiness Assessment offering personalized roadmap and ROI projections
- **Progressive Forms**: Multi-step contact forms with industry selection for lead qualification

### Flask Application (`app.py`)
- Serves static files from the root directory
- Handles routing for all static assets
- Implements error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Configured for production deployment with debug mode disabled

### Design System
- **Color Schemes**: Each page features unique gradient backgrounds
- **Glass Effects**: Consistent glassmorphism components across all pages
- **Typography**: Hierarchical font system with semantic font families
- **Animations**: CSS keyframe animations for floating elements and glowing effects

## Data Flow

1. **Request Handling**: Flask receives HTTP requests on port 5000
2. **Static File Serving**: Files are served directly from the root directory
3. **Fallback Logic**: Missing files redirect to the main index page
4. **Error Recovery**: All errors gracefully redirect to the homepage

## External Dependencies

### CDN Resources
- **Tailwind CSS**: `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com` - For styling and responsive design
- **Google Fonts**: Custom font loading for typography consistency

### Python Dependencies
- **Flask 3.1.1**: Web framework for serving static files
- **Python 3.11+**: Runtime environment

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Replit Configuration**: Configured for Python 3.11 with Nix stable-24_05 channel
- **Workflow**: Parallel execution with static website server task
- **Port Binding**: Automatic port detection and binding on 5000

### Production Considerations
- Debug mode disabled for security
- Environment variable support for port configuration
- Host binding to 0.0.0.0 for external access
- Error handling prevents application crashes

### Scalability Options
- Can be easily converted to serve from CDN
- Static nature allows for easy horizontal scaling
- Minimal server requirements due to static file serving
